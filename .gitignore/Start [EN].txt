Edward Hook:
- Geeks, scums, bastards! Hear me!

- My name is Edward Hook, I'm the captain of the third fleet of Kul Tiras! My path lies through Great Sea to the unexplored island. And I need food for powder. I need you!

- Yes! Today is your lucky day! Today is the day when you can end your worthless beings and give your miserable lives to the benefint of humanity! Come with me and I'll enrich those of you who's lucky enough to come back alive.

- So, who's willing to die?!


Edward Hook:
- What are you staring on, idiots?! Abroad!

Ahry:
- I beg you, captain. The deal brooks no delay. The council of Dalaran is ready...

Edward Hook:
- Listen, missy. The ocean doesn't care about gold. The ocean doesn't care about your council. The team is complete and there can't be a free seat. Especially for little girls. If you want to die so much go ahead and find a bunch of suicides.

Ahry:
- Damn on you...

Goblin:
- Madam! Forgive my rudeness, but I've accidentally overheard your conversation. And I think we could help each oher.
